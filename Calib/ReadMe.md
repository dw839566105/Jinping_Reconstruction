# calibration

Fit the training data via different method.

`main_Leg`: The 1st step of the varying coefficient method. Fit the PE/time vs $\theta$ under different $r$. 

`Gather.py`: The 2nd step of the varying coefficient method. Fit the coefficient vs $r$.

`main_dLeg`: Fit by double Legendre basis.

`main_Zernike`: Fit by Zernike polynomils.
